## Introduction

MediChain aims to address the challenges associated with the management of medical records by leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology. By utilizing a decentralized and immutable ledger, MediChain ensures the security, privacy, and integrity of medical data.

This repository contains the implementation of the MediChain system, including smart contracts, backend server, and frontend user interface.

## Features

- **Secure and Private**: Medical records are stored on a blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and encrypted storage, protecting sensitive patient information.
- **Decentralized**: The decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates the need for a central authority, increasing transparency and reducing the risk of data loss.
- **Permissioned Access**: Access to medical records can be controlled by the patients and authorized healthcare providers, ensuring privacy and data ownership.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every change made to medical records is recorded on the blockchain, providing an auditable history of data modifications.
- **Interoperability**: MediChain supports standard data formats and interfaces, enabling seamless integration with existing healthcare systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A user-friendly web-based interface allows patients and healthcare providers to interact with the system easily.

## Installation

To install and run MediChain locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/anj20/MediChain.git`
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - Navigate to the folder and run npm install --force
3. Configure the system:
   - Set up a blockchain network (e.g., Ganache) and update the connection details in the server configuration.
4. Deploy the smart contracts:
   - Compile the smart contracts using the Solidity compiler.
   - Deploy the contracts to your chosen blockchain network.
   - Update the contract addresses in the server configuration.
5. Start the client:
   - Run `npm start` in the directory to start the frontend user interface.
6. Access MediChain:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the provided address (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

## Usage

MediChain provides a user-friendly interface for patients and healthcare providers to manage medical records. The system allows patients to securely store their medical records, control access permissions, and view the audit trail. Healthcare providers can request access to patient records, view authorized records, and make necessary updates.
